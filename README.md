# 404 Orbiting Asteroids for JS13k 2020


Sounds 

I considered [jsfxr](https://github.com/mneubrand/jsfxr), but then found that [ZzFX micro](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX/blob/master/ZzFX.micro.js) is smaller and offered simple sound effects that I was looking for. I created the sounds by experimenting with [the ZzFX tool](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/), and put everything into a `sounds.js` file.
